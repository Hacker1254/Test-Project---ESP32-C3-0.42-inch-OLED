## ⚙️ [Issues with Adafruit_SSD1306? (AI)](https://github.com/peff74/ESP32-C3_OLED)

| Feature | U8g2 | Adafruit_SSD1306 |
|----------|------|------------------|
| **Performance on small displays** | Optimized partial refresh | Redraws full buffer every frame, wasting cycles |
| **RAM usage** | Lower — internal buffering optimized | Higher — full framebuffer stored in RAM, can cause crashes on small MCUs |
| **Drawing API** | Advanced — supports shapes, bitmaps, clipping, rotations | Very limited drawing commands |
| **Flicker-free buffering** | ✅ Dual-buffer rendering avoids flicker | ❌ Needs manual clear each frame, often flickers when redrawing text |
| **Code footprint** | Slightly larger but modular | Simple but less flexible |

## ⚡ Pinout Notes

| Signal | Default Pin |
|---------|--------------|
| SDA (OLED Display) | GPIO 5 |
| SCL (OLED Display) | GPIO 6 |

!!! Change these in `Globals.cpp` if your board uses different pins. !!!
